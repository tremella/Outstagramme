[FIXED] login method stopped working!

Signup method not fully operational:
    need a FETCH(POST) for a /signup endpoint,
    also need a post /signup method in express/app.js
    and a verifyNewUser function in express/routes/users.js
    also have to decide: should they be logged in automatically?
        immediate term: no. Just redirect to login page.
        long term: YES, inclusive of email auth.

login and signup passwords need to be hashed.

create a post function
    this is outside bounds of insta's web app.
    could imitate phone setup.
        click [+] button, interface of gallery comes up. 
        Select one, then proceed [->]
            ++ filter/edit, [->]
        write a caption, [âœ“]
            ++ tag people
            ++ add location

post interactions
    the components exist, but the functionality doesn't [yet]

messaging
    this will need a model
        list of previous convos [left] on same page as
        loaded convo [right]

activity
    this will need a model (?)
    it's a pop-up, not a page.
